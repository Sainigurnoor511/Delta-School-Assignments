## Purpose
This repository contains solution programs to AI python Assessment 1.
The purpose of this repository is to showcase different applications using Python. 

## Note :-

This repo contains two phonebook programs. The first phonebook app is implemented using an `if-elif` ladder.

The second phonebook app is an improved version implemented using `match-case` statements. It offers the same functionality as the first app but with a more concise and readable code structure.
